      <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete
        physical, mental, and social wellness, not merely the absence of disease
        or infirmity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mental health is a state of emotional, psychological, and social
        wellness evidenced by satisfying interpersonal relationships, effective
        behavior and coping, positive self-concept, and emotional stability.
      </p>
